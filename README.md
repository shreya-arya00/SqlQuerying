# Practical Task: Schema Modeling and SQL Queries

## Overview
This task involves creating a new project/module to model the schema for storing Continents, Countries, and People. After designing the database structure, we'll populate it with data and then write SQL queries to extract various insights.

## Task Description
1. **Schema Modeling:**
   - Define schema for storing Continents, Countries, and People.
   - Relationships:
     - Country belongs to a single continent.
     - Continent has many countries.
     - Country has many people; one person can belong to multiple countries (have multiple citizenships).
2. **Data Population:**
   - Populate the created tables with randomly generated data.
3. **SQL Queries for Countries:**
   - Identify the country with the biggest population.
   - List the top 10 countries with the lowest population density.
   - Retrieve countries with population density higher than the average across all countries.
   - Identify the country with the longest name.
   - List all countries with names containing the letter “F”, sorted alphabetically.
   - Find the country with a population closest to the average population of all countries.
4. **SQL Queries for Countries and Continents:**
   - Count the number of countries for each continent.
   - Calculate the total area for each continent, sorted by area from biggest to smallest.
   - Determine the average population density per continent.
   - For each continent, find a country with the smallest area.
   - Identify all continents with an average country population less than 20 million.
5. **SQL Queries for People:**
   - Identify the person with the most citizenships.
   - List all people who have no citizenship.
   - Determine the country with the least people in the People table.
   - Find the continent with the most people in the People table.
   - Identify pairs of people with the same name and print their IDs.

## Additional Notes
- This task aims to develop skills in schema modeling, SQL query writing, and data analysis.
- Ensure the SQL queries are efficient and provide accurate results.
- Utilize appropriate SQL functions and clauses for each query.
